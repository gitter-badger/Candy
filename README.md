# Candy
Candy is a Dynamic Entity REST API Generator

The idea is that the generated endpoints will be proper REST endpoints, with a WAD for discovery and documentation and with ou without authentication (basic or ldap).

The UI will be web based and it will be used to define the entities and specify security methods.

The first version will not be able to create relationships between entities but this will be done in versions further down the road...

## Why do this?

I recently came to work for a company that used a opensource project called "SugarCRM" has a way to very quickly and with low costs setup a dynamic entity management backoffice with a rest and soap api.

SugarCRM is a great product and very dynamic CRM... but it is, in its core, a CRM. The ideia with Candy is to make a dynamic entity manager with a rest api that everyone could use to setup a serverside enpoint in minutes for mobile and front-end development.
